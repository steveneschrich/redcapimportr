\title{Read REDCap import data into R}
\usage{
read_redcap_data(f)
}
\arguments{
\item{f}{A R script filename, or the R/CSV pairs as determined by \code{\link{return_filename_pair}}}
}
\value{
A \code{\link[tibble]{tibble}} of REDCap imported data.
}
\description{
REDCap exported data (exported to R) is read in with a few tweaks to the data
for usability.
}
\details{
REDCap allows a user to export all of the data in the project to R format. This results in
two files (an R file and a CSV file). Typically, one would simply source the R file and the
REDCap data would be available in the R session. However, there are a few small caveats with
this data, prompting the creation of this function.

Specifically, there are two issues:
\itemize{
\item Clearing the environment
\item No labels on factor variables
}

This function fixes those two issues and returns a \code{\link[tibble]{tibble}} for
further processing.
}
\note{
The input parameter to this function can be either the R script name, or the R/CSV pairs
as determined by \code{\link{return_filename_pair}}.
