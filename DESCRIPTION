Description: REDCap provides the opportunity to export the data from a
  project in a format suitable for importing into R. That is, except
  there are a few things that make it difficult to work with. Among
  the concerns are the specific object name, the fact that one-to-many
  relationships are in the same table, and that factors do not get labelled
  with the question label. Minor challenges all and not significant barriers.
  This package was developed to clean up these minor difficulties and produce
  data suitable for downstream processing.
